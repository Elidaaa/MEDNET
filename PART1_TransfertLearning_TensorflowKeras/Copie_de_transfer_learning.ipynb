One could imagine that these patterns are not 100% specific to the task but to the input images. \n","\n","üí° Therefore, **why not using convolutions that have been learnt on other task** with the expectation that it will also work in other scenario?  We _transfer_ a CNN from one task to another => _transfer learning_. This has two advantages:\n","- taking less time to train\n","- benefiting from complex architecture that have been trained for state-of-the-art challenges. \n","\n","‚ö†Ô∏è Although convolutions may not be specific, the last layer is by design specific to the problem it was trained on! Therefore, this last layer is usually removed, replace by a layer that is design to the task. As this new last layer has random weight, it has to be retrained. This is called _fine-tunning_. \n","\n","#### VGG16\n","In this exercise, we will use the [VGG-16 Neural Network](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/), a well-known architecture that has been trained on ImageNet which is a very large database of images of different categories. In a nutshell, this architecture has already learnt kernels which are supposed to be good not only for the task it has been train on but maybe for other tasks. \n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://neurohive.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vgg16-1-e1542731207177.png\" width=400></center>\n","\n","The idea is that first layers are not specialized for the particular task it has been trained on ; only the last ones are. Therefore, we will \n","- load the existing VGG16 network\n","- remove the last fully connected layers\n","- replace them by new connected layers (whose weights are randomly set)\n","- and train these last layers on a specific classification task - here, separate types of flower. \n","\n","The underlying idea is that the first convolutional layers of VGG-16, that has already been trained, corresponds to filters that are able to extract meaning features from images.

To do that, here are some options you can consider\n","\n","1. **Unfreeze and finetune**: As per [Google tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/transfer_learning#fine-tuning) \n",">_Once your model has converged on the new data, you can try to unfreeze all or part of the base model and retrain the whole model end-to-end with a very low learning rate. This is an optional last step that can potentially give you incremental improvements. It could also potentially lead to quick overfitting -- keep that in mind. It is critical to only do this step after the model with frozen layers has been trained to convergence. If you mix randomly-initialized trainable layers with trainable layers that hold pre-trained features, the randomly-initialized layers will cause very large gradient updates during training, which will destroy your pre-trained features. It's also critical to use a very low learning rate at this stage, because you are training a much larger model than in the first round of training, on a dataset that is typically very small. As a result, you are at risk of overfitting very quickly if you apply large weight updates. Here, you only want to readapt the pretrained weights in an incremental way._\n","\n","\n","1. Add **data augmentation** if your model is overfitting. \n","\n","1. If your model is not - unlikely here - , try a more complex model.\n","\n","1. Perform precise **grid search** on all the hyper-parameters: learning_rate, batch_size, data augmentation etc...\n","\n","1. **Change the base model** to more modern one (resnet, efficient net1. available in the keras library\n","\n","1.
